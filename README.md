# Redis - key/value in-memory database :

    - Story behind Creation of Redis :

    Redis was created about three years ago for practical reasons: basically, I was trying to do the impossible with an on-disk SQL database. I was handling a large write-heavy load with the only hardware I was able to afford—a little virtualized instance.
    My problem was conceptually simple: my server was receiving a stream of page views from multiple websites using a small JavaScript tracker. I needed to store the lat- est n page views for every site and show them in real time to users connected to a web interface,
    while maintaining a small history.

    With a peak load of a few thousand page views per second, whatever my database schema was, and whatever trade-offs I was willing to pick, there was no way for my SQL store to handle the load with such poor hardware. My inability to upgrade the hard- ware for cost
    concerns coupled with the feeling that to handle a capped list of values shouldn’t have been so hard, after all, gave me the idea of creating a throw-away pro- totype of an in-memory data store that could handle lists as a native data type, with constant-time pop
    and push operations on both sides of the lists. To make a long story short, the concept worked, I rewrote the first prototype using the C language, added a fork-based persistence feature, and Redis was born.


    - Author is first use of Redis :

    + My first experience with Redis was at a company that needed to search a data- base of client contacts. The search needed to find contacts by name, email address, location, and phone number. The system was written to use a SQL database that performed a series of queries
      that would take 10–15 seconds to find matches among 60,000 clients. After spending a week learning the basics of what was available in Redis, I built a search engine that could filter and sort on all of those fields and more, returning responses within 50 milliseconds.
